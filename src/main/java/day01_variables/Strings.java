public class Strings {
    /*
    In Java, the String class is used to represent character strings.
    A String object holds a sequential collection of one or more characters.
    This character sequence can be either a constant or a variable, and can be of any length.
    String objects are commonly used in Java programming.
    For example, they can be used to store text entered by a user, or text read from a file.

    String objects can be manipulated extensively in Java programs.
    Operations such as adding, deleting, or modifying characters in the strings can be performed.
     Additionally, operations such as comparing string objects or finding substrings can also be performed.

    String objects can be created in many different ways in Java.
     The most common way to create a String object is to enclose the character sequence in double quotes (" ").
     */
    //For example:


    String name ="Eyl√ºl";

    // String objects can also be created using the new keyword.
    // For example:

    String surName = new String("Can");

    //In Java, String objects have many different methods.
    //These methods can be used to change the content of the String object, extract substrings, or split the String into an array of characters.
