public class Variables {
    //In Java, variables are named memory locations used to store temporary data in programs.
    // Java is a type-safe programming language, meaning that variables have a specific type, which determines what type of data the variable will hold.
    // In Java, variables are defined as follows

    //      -->      data_type variable_name;

    //In this example code, 'data_type' specifies the type of the variable, and 'variable_name' specifies the name of the variable.
    // Below are examples of different data types:

    //Variable declaration for integers:
    int number;

    //Variable declaration for decimals:
    double decimalNumber;

    //Variable declaration for characters:
    char letter;

    //Variable declaration for strings:

    String word;

    //Variable declaration for boolean data:
    boolean isTrue;
